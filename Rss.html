        <h2>Journey with</h2>
        <h3><span>Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)</span></h3>
        
        <p>
          Atul Rai's association with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)
          began during his school days. This early start led to a lifetime of
          dedication, and in July 2000, he became a full-time Sangh Pracharak, a
          role he served in until December 2021. Over these two decades, he took
          on various responsibilities for the Sangh in diverse locations,
          including Gwalior, Bhopal, Sehore, Rajgarh, Vidisha, and Jammu &amp;
          Kashmir.
        </p>
        <p>
          He notes that the work in Jammu &amp; Kashmir was comparatively more
          difficult than in other parts of India. He approached this challenge
          by applying the Sangh's core ideology and unique working style to make
          the task easier. A formative experience from his youth was doing
          service work in a Naxal-affected tribal area in the 9th grade through
          the NCC, which solidified his commitment to service.
